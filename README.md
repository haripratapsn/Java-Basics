Introduction

I am curentlly learning Java, and my current short term goal is to complete Java basics within 2025.

Java is a object oriented programming language, we create class which is the collection of function/methods and variables. In java the program will run from right to left.
But C and C++ are procedural language where each code is read line by line as a procedure in order.

System.out.println() is a function
"Hello World" is a string. String always should be in double courts

Don't forget the 
Statement terminator is used to denote the termination of the expression or the statement to the compiler
Statement terminator is ;

Program:-

Input:

public class Hello_world
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello World");(it is a statement)
    }
}

Output:-

Hello World


Task  1 Print your name in the idea j

public class task{
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Monkey D.Luffy")
   }
}
